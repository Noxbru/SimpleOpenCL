#summary General information and comments.

= Introduction =

This wiki is under construction. For some days it will be only used as a place to post basic information about the code or the project.

= Details =

By now I'm only providing source code. This release is a copy paste from the las version I've used. It's possible that there is something wrong in the code even I have almost changed nothing from the working version.

In few days I'll adapt some testing code to the standalone library configuration in order to test it.

Next steps will be filling the wiki, and improving and adding more features.
