This section shows how to use SimpleOpenCL. We only show First level functions in this section, that are the main goal of the project.

SimpleOpenCL eliminates the need of knowing about OpenCL objects. The only thing a programmer needs to know in order to use SimpleOpenCL is C, two SimpleOpenCL types, and few functions.
